# 🎓Urban Data Science & Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio, developed as part of the MSc in Urban Data Science & Analytics at the University of Leeds. This repository showcases a curated selection of academic assessments, geospatial analytics projects, and real-world consulting work at the intersection of **data, policy, and human outcomes**.

## 🌍 About Me

I'm a consultant, data analyst and scientist with experience spanning healthtech, HR analytics, and urban strategy. I use data to uncover hidden patterns, tell compelling stories, and design evidence-based interventions — always with people and equity at the core.
